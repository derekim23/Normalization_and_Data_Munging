# Description of Study
The overarching goal of this study is in the realm of multiomics data and how they relate to certain phenotypic measures.

# Metabolomics Munging Files
The core idea of these files is to merge open-source metabolomics dataset into a metabolomics dataframe of a DARPA study (code sanitized).
The athlete_norm_git.R file is an attempt at reverse engineering a batch normalization process conducted by Metabolon and replicating that on other raw datasets collected by the same company.
The corr_matrices_comp_git.R file is for comparing the empirical correlation matrices of metabolite abundances of two different datasets and highlighting correlations that are close.
