# Metabolomics Analysis
The first step of the metabolomics analysis invovles temporal clustering of metabolite abundance levels across four blood draws within each session. The follow-up is an across-session clustering, which involves fixing a certain blood draw and looking at it across sessions. At the core of these processes is the idea of vectorizing the slopes between two consecutive time points and then clustering these vectors with [fuzzy c-means clustering](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/Mfuzz/inst/doc/Mfuzz.pdf). The approach was inspired by the [tscR](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/manuals/tscR/man/tscR.pdf) package in R. 

The second step invovles analyzing the correlations between certain metabolites and metabolic ratios pre- and post-exercise to see if there are any patterns that coincide with those recorded in biological literature. Also, VO2Max values are regressed on metabolomic abundance levels to see if any molecules may be related to VO2Max variations across individuals.

The last step invovles applying [sparse canonical correlation analysis](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/PMA/PMA.pdf) to the dataset to achieve dimensionality reduction, to see if there is any meaningful way to relate a linear combination of the molecular data to a linear combination of the target phenotypes. Also, a [LASSO stability selection](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stabs/stabs.pdf) method is used to select features that may be fed into a machine learning pipeline for predictions of phenotypic targets.
